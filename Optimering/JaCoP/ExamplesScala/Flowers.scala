/**
 * 
 * It is quite complex logic puzzle about flowers.
 * 
 * @author Tomasz Szwed, Wojciech Krupa, and Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 * Each of four women in our office was delighted to receive a floral delivery at her desk this month. Each of the 
 * women (Emma, Kristin, Lynn, and Toni) received flowers from her husband (Doug, Justin, Shane, or Theo) for a 
 * different special occasion. Each bouquet consisted of a different type of flower, and each was delivered 
 * during the first four weeks of February. From the following clues, can you match each woman with her husband 
 * and determine the date on which each woman received flowers, the occasion for the flowers, and the type of 
 * flowers in each bouquet?
 * 
 *
 * Calendar for February
 *
 * Mon  Tue   Wed   Thu   Fri
 * -     1     2     3     4
 * 7    8     9    10    11
 * 14   15    16    17    18
 * 21   22    23    24    25
 *
 * 1. No two women received flowers on the same day of the week, and no two received flowers during the same week.
 *
 * 2. The woman who received flowers for Valentine's Day had them delivered on either Friday the 11th or 
 * Monday the 14th.
 *
 * 3. Emma received flowers one day later in the week than the woman who received flowers to celebrate a promotion.
 *
 * 4. Lynn received flowers either the week before or the week after the woman who received violets.
 *
 * 5. Justin's wife received flowers on either Monday the 7th (in which case she is the one who received white roses) 
 * or on Thursday the 24th (in which case she is the woman who received flowers to celebrate her birthday).
 *
 * 6. Theo's wife didn't receive flowers exactly eight days before the woman who received chrysanthemums.
 *
 * 7. Toni's husband is either Doug or Shane.
 *
 * 8. One woman received either chrysanthemums or white roses for her wedding anniversary.
 *
 * 9. Kristin received flowers on either Tuesday the 1st (in which case she is 
 * the one who received daisies) or Friday the 18th (in which case she received them from Doug).
 *
 * 10. Shane's wife received flowers during the second week of the month.
 *
 * Determine: woman, husband, date, occasion, type of flowers
